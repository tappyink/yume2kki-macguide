# yume2kki-macguide
A guide on how to install "Yume 2kki" on the latest version of macOS.

This guide serves as a way to provide clear, exact instructions on how to install Yume 2kki on the latest version of macOS. I found it struggling to install the game on my own, so I'm making this guide for future reference in case my files get corrupted, but also for the internet to view if they are having trouble playing the game themselves! 

This guide keeps in mind the people who aren't familiar with macOS, as well as a command line to make this guide as user-friendly and accessible as it can be.

Any (italicized text) indicates further important information below the (regular text), or provide a caption for an (image) above it.

Any (monospaced text)indicates a command that needs to be used in macOS's terminal application. To use those commands, either copy and paste it from this document into the window, or type it out yourself. Make sure there are no spelling errors when you type the commands though!

I'd also like to remind everyone referencing this to read the whole guide carefully! 

## this is a host page for the google doc that i've made! it is attached to this github page right below this!
### the first chapter has the exact same text that this markdown file has!
